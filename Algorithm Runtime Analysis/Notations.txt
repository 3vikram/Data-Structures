Algorithm Runtime Analysis (ARA):

Time an algorithm takes to run various given input of increasing size

We need to use ARA to measure the efficiency of an algorithm

Notations for ARA:

An algorithm will be tested against worst case, best case and average case.

Omega()/ minimum time, for any input, runtime of an algorithm will not be "less than" given time
Big-o (O)/ maximum time, for any input, runtime of an algorithm will not be "more than" given time 
Theta()/ average time, for any input, runtime of an algorithm will "on an average" be equal to given time

Recursion:

Properties of Recursion:

1. Same operation performed multiple times with different input values
2. In every step we try to make the problem smaller
3. We mandatorily need to have a base condition, which tells the system when to stop

Reasons to learn recursion:

1. Recursion is prefered over iteration when a given problem can be broken down to a similar small or sub problem
2. In Tree and graph algorithms recursion is mostly used to solve problems

Format of a recursive function:

1. Recursive case - Case where the function should recall itself
2. Base case - Case where the function does not need to recall itself (termination condition)

Example:

SampleRecursion (parameter) {
  if (base case is satisfied) {
    return some base case value
  else
    SampleRecursion (modified parameter)
  }
}

How Recursion works internally at stack memory?
